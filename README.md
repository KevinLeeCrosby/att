This is the AT&amp;T Software Engineer Coding Challenge.

The program Hurricane will identify the strong winds associated with hurricanes, tornados, etc.

The default settings are centered around Houston in 2008, to allow users to find hurricanes depending on the search radius, such as hurricane Ike, which hit Houston in 2008.

Data for 2017 is also available from the repository, to allow users to find hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston in 2017.

Note that HADOOP_HOME needs to be defined for Apache Spark to work.
